*DURATION*: 4 WEEKS

*MENTOR*: NEELA SANTOSH

my understanding and application of Python programming in real-world scenarios. Each task focused on a specific domain such as API integration, report automation, natural language processing (NLP), and machine learning (ML). Below is a brief overview of the tasks, along with the tools and technologies used and the editor I preferred throughout the internship.

Task 1: API Integration and Data Visualization
The first task involved creating a Python script that fetches data from a public API—OpenWeatherMap in my case—and visualizes the information using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Task 2: Automated Report Generation
In the second task,developed a script that reads data from a local CSV file, performs analysis I used pandas for data analysis and FPDF to format and export the data into a structured report.

Task 3: AI Chatbot with NLP
For Task 3, I built a simple chatbot using Natural Language Processing tools such as NLTK.

Task 4: Machine Learning Model Implementation

The final task required building a predictive model using Scikit-learn. I chose a spam detection model where the dataset was trained using the Naive Bayes algorithm.

Tools and Libraries Used:
Programming Language: Python

Overall, the internship was a valuable learning experience that enhanced my technical and problem-solving skills across different domains in Python.
